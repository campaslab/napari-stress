Napari-stress and the backend code have been developed by the [campas-lab](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/research/core-groups/campas). The code is open source and available on [github](https://github.com/campaslab/napari-stress) or through the [napari-hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-stress). It is based on the legacy version of STRESS that has been published on github [here](https://github.com/campaslab/STRESS).
