# About

To save you the trouble of going through lengthy workflows step by step to complete the STRESS-analysis (either from code or from the viewer), napari-stress provides some handy toolboxes that bundle up the biggest part of the functionality.

* [Droplet reconstruction](01_droplet_reconstruction/Readme.md): Allows to reconstruct droplets int pointclouds, both interactively or from code with a Jupyter notebook.
* [Measure stresses](02_measure_stress/Readme.md): Stress analysis toolbox, that produces all relevant layers for the stress analysis. The measured data can be retrieved from the features and the metadata of these layers.
* [Analyze everyting](03_analyze_everything/demo_analyze_everything.ipynb): Comprehensive notebook that shows how to use the droplet reconstruction and stress analysis toolboxes to analyze a whole dataset from code and produces all relevant plots.
