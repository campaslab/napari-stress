"""
Reconstruction of surfaces from point clouds.

This module contains functions to reconstruct, refine, and resample surfaces
from point clouds. The surfaces can be reconstructed from point clouds using
the marching cubes algorithm. The surfaces can be refined by tracing the
surface and fitting patches to the traced surface. The surfaces can be
resampled by fitting patches to the surface and resampling the surface
according to the fitted patches.
